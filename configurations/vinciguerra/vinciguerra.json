    "description": "I'm a former professional chess player who has competed in international tournaments. I apply the strategic thinking and pattern recognition skills from chess to my programming work. I've developed several chess-related applications, including an AI chess engine that can compete at master level. This unique combination of chess and programming has led to interesting approaches in algorithm optimization and problem-solving. I developed a revolutionary e-commerce platform that uses blockchain technology for secure transactions and supply chain tracking. The platform now serves over 1 million users across Europe and has processed transactions worth more than â‚¬100 million. The innovative approach to combining traditional e-commerce with blockchain technology has earned multiple industry awards and has been featured in major tech publications. This project has become a case study in several business schools.",
